# Walnut Audio Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Walnut Audio is an MPD (Music Player Daemon) client that allows you to control your personal music server. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Walnut Audio collects, stores, and transmits.

## Data Collection

**Walnut Audio does not collect any personal data.**

We do not:
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal information
- Use advertising or ad tracking
- Share any data with third parties

## Accessibility Permission

  Maestro requests Accessibility permission solely to enable global
  keyboard shortcuts for music playback control. This allows you to
  control your music (play/pause, skip tracks, adjust volume) from
  any app without switching windows.

  What this permission does:
  • Enables system-wide keyboard shortcut detection
  • Allows playback control regardless of which app is active

  What this permission does NOT do:
  • Does not read, record, or transmit any keystrokes
  • Does not access any other applications or their data
  • Does not collect any personal information

  This permission is optional. If declined, all other app features
  remain fully functional - only global shortcuts will be disabled.

## Data Storage

Walnut Audio stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Server Profiles**: MPD server connection details (hostname, port) that you configure
- **Streaming Settings**: Your preferences for HTTP audio streaming
- **Song Cache**: Temporary cache of song metadata for faster searching

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.

## Network Connections

Walnut Audio connects only to:

1. **Your MPD Server**: The music server you configure in the app. Connection details are stored locally and used only to communicate with your server.

2. **Your Streaming Server**: If you enable HTTP streaming, the app connects to your configured streaming endpoint.

3. **Local Network Discovery**: Walnut Audio uses Bonjour/mDNS to discover MPD servers on your local network. This is a local-only protocol and does not transmit data over the internet.

4. **Apple App Store**: For subscription management and purchases through Apple's standard StoreKit framework.

## Subscriptions

Walnut Audio offers subscription-based access. Subscription purchases and management are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.

## Data Deletion

All app data is stored locally on your device. To delete all Walnut Audio data:
- Delete the app from your device

This removes all stored profiles, settings, and cached data.

## Children's Privacy

Walnut Audio does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is a music player remote control with no social features or data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.

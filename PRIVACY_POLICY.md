# MpdIOS Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

MpdIOS is an MPD (Music Player Daemon) client that allows you to control your personal music server. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data MpdIOS collects, stores, and transmits.

## Data Collection

**MpdIOS does not collect any personal data.**

We do not:
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal information
- Use advertising or ad tracking
- Share any data with third parties

## Data Storage

MpdIOS stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Server Profiles**: MPD server connection details (hostname, port) that you configure
- **Streaming Settings**: Your preferences for HTTP audio streaming
- **Song Cache**: Temporary cache of song metadata for faster searching

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.

## Network Connections

MpdIOS connects only to:

1. **Your MPD Server**: The music server you configure in the app. Connection details are stored locally and used only to communicate with your server.

2. **Your Streaming Server**: If you enable HTTP streaming, the app connects to your configured streaming endpoint.

3. **Local Network Discovery**: MpdIOS uses Bonjour/mDNS to discover MPD servers on your local network. This is a local-only protocol and does not transmit data over the internet.

4. **Apple App Store**: For subscription management and purchases through Apple's standard StoreKit framework.

## Subscriptions

MpdIOS offers subscription-based access. Subscription purchases and management are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.

## Data Deletion

All app data is stored locally on your device. To delete all MpdIOS data:
- Delete the app from your device

This removes all stored profiles, settings, and cached data.

## Children's Privacy

MpdIOS does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is a music player remote control with no social features or data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.

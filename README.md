# Maple Audio
MPD Client for iOS

Pure music control for MPD

Maple Audio is a streamlined MPD (Music Player Daemon) client designed for music lovers who want efficient control without visual distractions. Text-based, fast, and focused.

HOW IT WORKS

Maple Audio is built around two primary listening modes:

ALL MUSIC MODE
- Load your entire library with shuffle on
- As you listen, search and queue songs one after another
- Queued songs play next, then shuffle continues
- Discover and rediscover tracks effortlessly

PLAYLIST MODE
- Load curated playlists for focused sessions
- Want to add a song from outside the playlist? Use Search More to find any song in your library
- Queue it without replacing your current playlist

SMART QUEUE MANAGEMENT

Build your listening session without interruption:
- Add to Queue — Queue songs to play next without clearing what's playing
- Priority System — Queued songs play before shuffle continues
- Queue View — See and manage your upcoming tracks

SHOW SONG IN LIST

Hear a track that reminds you of another song from the same album or folder? Tap Show Song in List to jump to that song's location in your queue. Browse nearby tracks, then play or queue what you want to hear next.

EXCLUSIVE PLAY

Sometimes you want to focus on one artist or album:
- By Artist — Clear queue, load all songs by an artist, shuffle, play
- By Album — Clear queue, load full album, shuffle, play

One tap to dive deep.
